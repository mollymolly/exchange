""" Introduction
---------------------------------------
This module analyzes intensity changes in confocal images of cells expressing 
mEos-vimentin :superscript:`Y117L` as described in "Vimentin filament 
precursors exchange subunits in an ATP-dependent manner" Am√©lie Robert, Molly 
Rossow, Caroline Hookway, Stephen A. Adams and Vladimir I. Gelfand (Accepted to 
PNAS June 2015.)


The experiments described by Robert *et al.* use a photoconvertible fluorophore
(mEos3.2) to track the behavior of a mutant of the vimentin protein 
(vimentin :superscript:`Y117L`) that forms oligomers known as unit length 
filaments (ULFs). Fluorescently labeled ULFs are visible as bright particles 
in cells. The fluorophore mEos converts from green to red when exposed to UV 
light. To observe how mEos-vimentin :superscript:`Y117L` is incorporated into 
ULFs we photoconverted one region of the cell and observed fluorescence 
accumulate in the ULFs elsewhere in the cell. This analysis software measures 
the change in intensity in ULFs. 

Work Flow
----------------------------------------
Robert *et al.* used ulfexchange.py to analyze confocal images of confocal images
of cells expressing mEos-vimentin :superscript:`Y117L` with the following steps:

1. **Bleach correction**: Red channel images were bleach corrected by scaling 
   each image so that its mean was the same as the first image.
2. **ULF intensity calculation**: Coordinates of the center of each ULF in each 
   frame (obtained separately using the green channel) were used to measure the 
   intensity of each ULF in each red frame by calculating the average fluorescence 
   in a circle of fixed size centered at these coordinates.
3. **Background subtraction**: The intensity of each ULF before conversion was 
   subtracted from all its post-conversion intensities.
4. **Normalization between data sets**: ULF intensities were normalized by 
   dividing by the background subtracted intensity in the photoconverted region.
5. **Numerical and graphical results** Slope calculations, plotting, values 
   written file, etc.

The function analyzeDataSet implements the workflow described above. Further 
details of the analysis are included in Robert *et. al.* 

Required inputs
------------------------------------------
This analysis takes as input four files: 

1. A TIFF file containing a time series of red channel images of the 
   mEos-vimentin :superscript:`Y117L` cells after photo conversion.
2. A TIFF file with a times series green channel images corresponding to the 
   first tiff file. 
3. A TIFF file with a single red channel image of the same cell before photo 
   conversion for determining the background fluorescence. 
4. A text file containing the coordinates for the ULFs of interest in each 
   frame. For the work described in Robert *et al.* 
   `Diatrack <http://diatrack.org/>`_\ was used to obtain these coordinates. 


Naming convention for batch processing
--------------------------------------------
The function runBatch performs a complete 5-step analysis on multiple sets of 
data. Each data file described above needs to be named with the following 
convention: 

1. rootname + red + number + .tif
2. rootname + green + number + .tif
3. rootname + before + number + .tif
4. rootname + .txt 

Where rootname is a name that is the same for all files in the batch and number
is unique. 

For example if rootname is control the following files are an allowed data set: 

===== =============== ====================== 
#     Contents        Name
===== =============== ======================
1     Red channel     control_red01.tif
2     Green channel   control_green01.tif
3     Red background  control_before01.tif
4     Coordinates     control_01.tif
===== =============== ======================

Outputs
----------------------------------------------
The function runBatch generates a number of out put files. Each individual data 
set (comprised of the four files described above) generates the following five
files: 

1. An excel file containing the intensities of each ULF and it's distance from 
   the photoconverted region. 
2. A png file with the red and green channel of the first frame. The red channel 
   shows the region of photo conversion as a red circle. The green channel shows 
   the tracks of the ULFs. 
3. A png file with a plot of the slope the intensity in the converted region 
   versus time.
4. A png file with all intensities for all ULFs plotted versus time.
5. A png file with ULF intensities plotted versus time grouped by distance from 
   the converted region. 

In addition, two batch files are generated summarizing the results of all data
sets analyzed in the batch. 

1. An excel file allslopes.xlsx contain the slopes for all ULFs in the batch 
   groups by distance from the converted region by sheet of the spread sheet.
2. A png file all_intensities_by_distance.png that contains plots of all ULF 
   intensities grouped by distance from the converted region. 

The file exchangeExample.py contains and example of using runBatch.

Example
-----------------------------------------------
Below is an example script for calling runBatch on three sets of data::
        

    from ulfexchange import  runBatch
    import os
    
    # Set up inputs
    # The directory where the data is stored
    directory = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 
    'sample data')
    # File numbers of the files to be analyzed as strings
    fileNumbers = ['002','004','006']
    # The root name of each file. For example, one file in this set is 
    # control002red.tif. 
    rootName = 'control'
    
    # Set the location and the radius of the converted region. This is determined 
    # experimentally. 
    (covertedCenter, convertedRadius) = ((147.0, 116.0), 50)
    
    # Call the analysis routine
    runBatch(fileNumbers, directory, rootName, covertedCenter, convertedRadius, 
    background = True)
